A school assignment

The function of this project is to be able to simulate one's bank balance and the interest accrued monthly both with and without monthly deposits.

I think I organized my class functions particularly well.

I am not sure where I can enhance my code. If I knew, I would have done it when I programmed it initially.

Figuring out how to compound the interest was the most challenging part.

Writing class functions and knowing how to compound interest will both be useful later down the line.

I made this program readable, maintable, and adaptable by having the main function minimal with descriptive functions and those functions break the problem down into smaller steps.
